a module is just like a box, this box contain some codes which is dedicated to doing one thing well, and so we label the box with a name like http.js, which correspond to the name of our module, we combine this modules with each others to crate more complex structure which all together make up our program that relies on all of this module working together to achieve our goal

1, Reuse existing code
2, Organise your code
3, Expose only what will be ueed
